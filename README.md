# Toward Efficient Permutation for Hierarchical N:M sparsity on GPUs

## Introduction
This project introduces a novel permutation technique for hierarchical N:M sparsity on GPUs, termed "Gyro-Permutation." This technique addresses several key aspects critical for efficient sparsity implementation in deep learning models.

## Contributions
Our contributions with the Gyro-Permutation technique include solutions to the following key aspects:
1. **Hierarchical Pruning Awareness** - Ensuring the pruning process is aware of the hierarchical structure of neural networks.
2. **Consistency across Layers** - Maintaining consistency in sparsity patterns across different layers of the network.
3. **Escaping Local Minima** - Designing mechanisms to escape local minima during the training process, which can hinder the learning phase.
